# Ohio 5 GitHub / Git Tutorial

1. Sign up for a GitHub account:

* Visit github.org and sign up for your own account.
* Avoid capital letters, numbers, punctuation if possible. You might still be able to use them, but why play with fate like that?
* Pick a name that is good for a professional audience
* It's hard (but impossible) to change your name, so put some thought into it.

2. Set up team pages.
	* Break into teams
	* Make a GitHub Organization with a name that reflects your team. You can change it later if you want, but you'll need to change your repository name as well.
	* One person will need to make the GitHub organization, and this person will then have to add the other team members as contributors.
	* Make it something professional - your domain name will draw upon this.

3. Make a project repository
	* Click the new repository button.
	* The name your repository will be different dependent on your organization name: username + github.io.
	Ie. for an organization called awesomeohio your repository would be awesomeohio.github.io. 
	* Check the box to initialize your project with a readme.
	* Make your repository public.

3. GitHub Issues page.
	* Make an issue
	* Assign that issue to a team member.
	* Make the text of it "Make an index.html page."
4. Make an index.html page
	* one member should add a file called "index.html"
	Review GitHub Pages and get that set up.

4. Adding code. 
3. Tour of Issue tracker
